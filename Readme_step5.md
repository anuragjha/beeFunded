# cs686 - Project 5 Final

- No submission required. Complete your project in your github repository. 
- The repository should have 15-minute demo of your project 5 and the final report in README.md in addition to the completed code.

#### The demo should include the following:

- 1) What your DApp does (e.g., decentralized used book marketplace, benefits of using blockchain in this DApp)

- 2) Demonstrate the implemented functionalities (e.g,, show how the seller can upload the description, how the buyer can send a purchase transaction, and how the sender/buyer match is decided when there are multiple sellers and/or buyers for the same book.)

- 3) Explain how you implemented the functionalities above while showing the relevant code. (e.g. how the miners run a RESTful API to receive the sellers' book descriptions and the buyers' purchase or as a transaction, how the miners circulate these TXs and decide which TX to include in their blocks, and how the seller-buyer matching is implemented.)

- 4) Compare what you planned in the proposal, in the midpoint report, and what you actually accomplished by the midpoint and by the final version. Explain why you think the gap happened. (e.g, the Nakamoto consensus algorithm based on PoW took too long to confirm purchase so consensus algorithm had to be changed.)
